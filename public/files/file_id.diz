Auto Mute makes any computer silent 
by default. Program turns the sound 
off when the user is logging off, 
pc is going to sleep or suspend mode, 
computer is switched off. So the next 
system start is absolutely quiet. 

Also you can turn the sound on and off 
using a keyboard shortcut.

Works on any 32 or 64 bit Windows. 
There is Max OS X edition.
